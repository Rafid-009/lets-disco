This is my first time using [Three JS](https://threejs.org/). Thanks to designcourse I have learned a lot of the basics and got myself into this wonderful Java Script tool/framework or what ever you would call it.

<b>This was just a fun project that I tried.</b>

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Additional

* Hosted on [GitHub](http://Rafid-009.github.io/lets-disco)
* PWA Supported. (Think so)
